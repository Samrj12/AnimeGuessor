## How It Works

1. You think of an anime from a pre-defined knowledge base.
2. The LLM generates yes/no questions to narrow down its options.
3. You respond with Yes / No / Not Sure.
4. After 5 questions (or earlier if confident), the model attempts a final guess.
5. You decide if it was right.

Behind the scenes:
- A structured knowledge base in `.txt` or `.json` format holds metadata for 15+ popular anime titles.
- The app uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro for natural language reasoning.
- Memory of prior Q&A helps the model refine future questions and narrow the possibilities.
